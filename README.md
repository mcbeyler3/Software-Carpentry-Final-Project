# Introduction
 Study Companion is a desktop application built in Python that helps students plan, study, and reflect on their progress more effectively. It combines time management tools, interactive learning, and motivational features, all within a GUI-based interface.

Built with Python and a GUI using tkinter, this tool brings together useful features like a study planner, Pomodoro timer, quiz generator, analytics dashboard, calendar sync, and even a virtual pet to keep you motivated.

# Features
 - Study Planner: Create a personalized study schedule based on your tasks, priorities, available time, and calendar conflicts. 
 - Pomodoro Timer:  Break down your study time into focused work intervals with breaks in between and includes logging, visual feedback, and demo mode for quick testing.
 - Clipboard Quiz Generator: Paste in or import text from your clipboard to generate a summary and quiz questions
 - Analytics Dashboard: Visualize your productivity over time with bar charts showing how many Pomodoros you completed each day.
 - Virtual Study Pet: A friendly ASCII pet that grows and levels up the more you study
 - Calendar Integration: Import your existing .ics calendar file to avoid scheduling conflicts and export your study plan directly to your calendar app.
   
# How to Run
- Make sure you have Python 3.10 installed (we used Anaconda, but any environment works).
- Install required packages: matplotlib, pyperclip, and ics
- Run study_companion.py to launch the app.
